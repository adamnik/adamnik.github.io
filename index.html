          <h3 class="title mb-3">Research Interests</h3>
            <p>My broad research interests pertain to how we can build and train computers to learn and perform language in the same manner that humans do.
               My specific research interests include:
              <ul>
                <li><b>Conversational Agents</b>: I am interested in building dialgue systems, specifically open-domain dialogue systems, and working towards improving response coherence and modeling long-term context in coversation.</li>
                <li><b>Natural Language Generation</b>: I view natural language generation as an integral component of many other NLP topics, including dialogue systems, and therefore want to build on the state-of-the-art techniques of the field.</li>
                <li><b>Reinforcement Learning in NLP</b>: I want to explore how we can use natural instuctions to teach RL agents, in terms of both direct instruction following and extracting information from natural language in the environment space.</li>
                <li><b>Generalized NLP</b>: How can we expand the scope of what a given model is capable of and generalize a model to perform a breadth of tasks?</li>
              </ul>
             </p>

                <b>Snake Game AI with Approximate Q-Learning Agent</b>
                <br>
                <p>This project is an implementation of a Snake Game AI agent using an approximate Q-learning algorithm. This project was my final project for <em>CS321: Making Decisions with AI</em>, which I took in the Fall of 2021. The course was one of my first introductions to the field of artificial intelligence, and the production of this project sparked my interest in  Reinforcement Learning.

                <b><em>Scenify</em>, Senior Computer Science Comps Project</b>
                <br>
                <p>In my Senior Comps Project, my group and I created a route generation application that focused on optimizing the scenic value of the route, rather than time or distance. We quantified the scenic value of candidate routes by querying Flickr images along the routes and inferring scenic qualities from the images by classifying them using a convolutional neural network.

                <b>Ping Pong LED Snake Game Board</b>
                <br>
                <p>I built an 8x8 wooden LED board with ping pong balls as diffusers as part of my capstone project of <em>CS232: Art, Interactivity, and Robotics</em>. To go along with the board, I coded a Snake game compatible with Arduino board that links to the LED board. The board is thus a user-playable Snake game that uses a joystick as controls to the game. The project provided me with ample experience with working with electronics, as I completed all soldering, wiring, and circuit board work necessary for the board.

                <b>Essay: Survey on Natural Language Generation in Open-Domain Dialogue Systems</b>
                <br>
                <p>I wrote this essay as my final paper for <em>CGSI130: What Minds Are What They Do: An Introduction to Cognitive Science</em>. It is a brief survey on neural approaches to natural language generation and the current challenges of language generation in open-domain dialogue systems. The motivation behind the topic came from studying Turing's ideas of how machines can demonstrate human cognitive abilities and Rumelhart's connectionist architectures of the mind from the 1980s, both of which we studied earlier in the course.

          <h3 class="title mb-3">About me</h3>
            <p>I grew up in Nashville, TN, and moved to Minnesota when I was 13 and have been living here since. Outside of academics, I spend most of my time playing sports and staying active. In college, I was a <a href="sports_images.html">two-sport varsity athlete</a> (football and swimming), and I stay active nowadays by lifting, hiking, and going on walks. Additionally, I have three <a href="cat_images.html">cats</a>, named Mocha, Ali, and Rosie.
